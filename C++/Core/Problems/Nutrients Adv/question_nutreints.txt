Dietian Program
A dietitian in a hospital has to prepare the food-chart for the patient. Based on the  total carbohydrate, protein and fat content in the given set of food, the dietitian has  to make the suggestions. 
Given a set of food items with the details  such as the carbohydrate-content, fat-content, protein-content, design an OOP model and develop a C++ program to find the total amount of nutrients such as 
Carbohydrates, fats, protein, in the given set of food items. Understand the application code and provide the C++ implementation. Overload '+' operator to add the two nutrients in two food items 
and overload [] to  return the carbohydrate-content when index is 0, return the  protein-content when the index is 1 and return the fat when index-content when the index  is 2. 
If the index is greater than 2 then throw an integer exception.
